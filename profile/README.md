At GIS • OPS we’re passionately developing **geospatial software** for our clients. We exclusively work with **open-source** libraries/software and publish & maintain many projects ourselves.

Our core areas of expertise:

- routing applications/libraries in the widest sense (we're co-maintainers of [Valhalla](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla))
- PostgreSQL/PostGIS/pgRouting (we're financially supporting [@cvvergara](https://github.com/cvvergara) to further develop pgRouting)
- juggling OSM data and its wealth of analysis tools
- QGIS plugin development
- web development, obviously often with maps

Our preferred projects integrate all these areas in a single use case. 

We're dedicated to the open-source projects we publish and maintain, and encourage our employees and interns to dedicate some of their work time to collaborate on open-source libraries and apps.
